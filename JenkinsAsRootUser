1. Open up the this script (using VIM or other editor):

vim /etc/sysconfig/jenkins
2. Find this $JENKINS_USER and change to “root”:

$JENKINS_USER="root"
3. Then change the ownership of Jenkins home, webroot and logs:

chown -R root:root /var/lib/jenkins
chown -R root:root /var/cache/jenkins
chown -R root:root /var/log/jenkins
4) Restart Jenkins and check the user has been changed:

service jenkins restart
ps -ef | grep jenkins
